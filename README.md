Adiphy was a website that would give you money if you watched sponsored news articles.

  This is a script that i used with TamperMonkey chrome extension in order to automatically make page clicks, refresh and close.
It loaded a webpage, waited for a timer and proceed to the following, thus giving the money whithout giving the attentions they required.

There was no disclaimer on the terms and conditions that forbade the use of such scripts.


The page is now down, but the code can be adapted!
Wish you the best!
